# Open Communities

_“Go to the people. Live with them. Learn from them. Love them.” — Lao Tzu_

## The Open Internet

For the first 40 years of the internet, the relationship between data, capital, and ownership has been managed by trusted third parties. Institutions like AOL, Google, and Bank of America have had full control over data flow, with the power to peel back privacy and censor transactions. However asymmetric cryptography has provided common people with the keys to a digital kingdom. Public-private key pairs have replaced permission with power, allowing individuals to reclaim ownership over their digital lives. To send money, buy art, or form communities, one no longer needs to cross the drawbridge of third party approval. The walled garden is crumbling and Web3 is bringing the fruit of digital interaction (and ownership) to everyone. 

Decentralized protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on a decentralized network of nodes united by a common ledger of transactions. Consensus is bottom-up: with common truth emerging from common rules. From chaos comes order. As value and ideas have concentrated around this idea of decentralized consensus, people have gathered to build, schill, and create the future of the internet: from maxies hodling on r/bitcoin to defi degens spinning twitter threads across the Twitterverse. 

The internet is designed to bypass physical limitations, allowing online communities to form and scale in seconds. However, as online communities grow from a few close individuals to a network of strangers, there are inevitable struggles with toxicity and engagement. When membership is permissionless and participation is pseudonymous, traditional community management techniques fail. The same principles that have allowed decentralized protocols to succeed, can cause online communities to struggle. But a better understanding of what an online community is and how to measure it can help us all build better virtual gathering spaces.

An online community is a group of people united by a common topic. Unlike a religion, belief need not be shared and unlike a nation state, geography need not be common. The borders of an online community are purely digital, a thin strip of ones and zeroes that separate one community from the next. On Reddit these borders are forums, on Discord these borders are channels, and on Twitter these borders are threads. Membership is fluid and, unlike traditional communities, exit is always an option. However, this loose definition of membership is the number one killer of online communities. 

## Three Ways Communities Die

_Death By Noise_

Exponential user growth often leads to exponential spam and noise. Unwanted, unsolicited, and irrelevant contributions bury enthusiasm under a pile of nonsense. When you can no longer hear the heartbeat of common interest, you know your online community has died.

_Death by Hate_

When relationships between people are managed by computers, civil discourse is often replaced by common disgust. This disgust is magnified by toxic trolls who excel at fracturing communities into shards of hate. 

_Death by Dead_

People join, but no one participates. Lack of engagement feeds further lack of engagement and pretty soon the community is dead. Silence has inertia, so attempts to resuscitate the community are likely to fail.

There are many bones within the graveyard of online communities: the internet reaper has no mercy. When we open digital borders and remove permissions, we also remove filters that defend against bad actors. But in the 21st century, we have the tools to defend the open online communities we love; we have the tools to connect. Behind every computer is a human, and within every human is the capacity to love and understand.

However, digital spaces have the tendency to dehumanize participants. Personalities are reduced to usernames and worth is reduced to likes, retweets, followers, etc — single numbers that are incremented on remote servers. While likes, followers, and karma are a good way to increase user growth and retention, we need different metrics to measure the community as a whole. User count will not suffice. As many groups have shown, the quantity of community members has nothing to do with the quality of the community. This makes sense when we shift our understanding of community from a single number to a set of interactions between members. The goal of every community should be to facilitate positive interactions between members in order to build a better understanding of ourselves and our common interests. 

## Community Metrics

What follows are three questions to evaluate your permissionless community:



1. _What is the distribution of community contributors?_

    While everyone  can participate within permissionless communities, 20% of members typically account for 80% of contributions. These lopsided levels of participation hurt collective engagement and minimize the diversity open communities promise. 


    To calculate the distribution of contributors, plot the number of contributions— likes, posts, comments, etc— for each member on a graph. Uniform engagement will result in a [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution), while lopsided engagement will produce a [pareto distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution). 


    Note: this model treats each interaction equally. You may want to weight contributions by significance, i.e. one tweet is worth more than a like. This approach accounts for commitment.

2. _What is the median time between member contributions?	_

    A cohesive community begins with consistent engagement. An active community will have a lower median time between member contributions than an inactive community. This is a more consistent metric than monthly active users (MAUs) as MAUs do not standardize ‘active’, while time is a standard we can all agree upon.

3. _How satisfied is the community?_

    Happy members are essential for a healthy community. Regular member polls can help quantify the quantitative nature of satisfaction. Try quick surveys to collect feedback. Post analysis is another option, but genuine inquiries often work better than an unconscious machine learning model. 

## Uncharted Spaces

Fiber optic networks span the world, transcending geography and creating common spaces we must learn to share. Bits and bytes are here to stay. But humanity does not end where computers begin. We are all capable of being better community members, of sharing the joy of life with fellow humans— connected by wires, radio waves, and our common endeavor into uncharted digital spaces.
